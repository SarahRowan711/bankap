### Installation
To run this app, clone the bankapp repository and run 'npm start' in the project directory.

### Technology stack details
This project was built with the create-react-app environment and can be run with Node.js. It will be refactored to include an Express server and MongoDB datastore.

### Features
Currently, this app allows a user to create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, and view their user history. This functionality is very limited and includes no authentication, so multiple users can be created, but only the most recently created will work with the deposit/withdraw functionality.

### Roadmap
This project will be refactored to include authentication and permanent user data storage.
